The f means Formatted string literals and it's new in Python 3.6.

A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. 
These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}.
 While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions 
 evaluated at run time.
